### Accessibility to Software
Please check the releases in this repository: https://github.com/asrivathsan/ONTbarcoder/releases. The latest version of the software 0.1.9 has information on the files to use for MacOS in the release page, please choose the relavent one. The ONTBarcoder_manual.pdf details more detailed guidelines for troubleshooting in case of issues.
####Windows
Unzip [ONTBarcoder_0.1.9_exe.win-amd64-2.7.zip](https://github.com/asrivathsan/ONTbarcoder/releases/download/0.1.9/ONTBarcoder_0.1.9_exe.win-amd64-2.7.zip) and double click on the executable. In default mode the output files are stored in the same directory as the executable

Windows has a character limit of path length as 256 characters. Therefore, please avoid placing the software deep inside the directory structure. Avoid spaces in folder names

####Macintosh
Use the DMGs for the version corresponding to your Mac. We recommend using the upgraded Mac (macOS 11) and corresponding dmg file [ONTbarcoder_0.1.9_OS11.dmg](https://github.com/asrivathsan/ONTbarcoder/releases/download/0.1.9/ONTbarcoder_0.1.9_OS11.dmg). We have also compiled for older versions; [ONTbarcoder_0.1.9_OSX10_13.dmg](https://github.com/asrivathsan/ONTbarcoder/releases/download/0.1.9/ONTbarcoder_0.1.9_OSX10_13.dmg) has been tested in macOS 10.13 and 10.12. We would suggesting using this in first pass for 10.14/15

In case DMG files give problems due to permission, you may use the standalone.tgz: [macOS 11](https://github.com/asrivathsan/ONTbarcoder/releases/download/0.1.9/ONTbarcoder_0.9.1_OSX11_standalone.tgz), [macOS 10.13](https://github.com/asrivathsan/ONTbarcoder/releases/download/0.1.9/ONTbarcoder_0.1.9_OS10.13_standalone.tgz) files. THese will contain numerous executables and the software should be run using ONTbarcoder_multiprocessing.

####Linux
Uncompress the tgz archive [ONTbarcoder_multiprocessing_0.1.9_linux.tgz](https://github.com/asrivathsan/ONTbarcoder/releases/download/0.1.9/ONTbarcoder_multiprocessing_0.1.9_linux.tgz).  Start the software from the terminal as by 
cd directory_containing_ONTbarcooderfiles
./ONTbarcoder_multiprocessing
